# Fusion-360-STEP-STP-exporting-scrips
Different scrips that will make exporting complicated designs much faster!


# Scripts
Script 1: 
  A script when run that will export every body of that design as STEP files. (STEP files are supported in 3D printer slicers)
Scrpit 2:
  A script when run that will export only the selected bodies as STEP files. (STEP files are supported in 3D printer slicers) 

# Instilation
1) Open Fusion 360
2) On the tool bar (at the top) navigate to utilities
3) Click on the image right about the line ADD-INS
4) Select Create (a pop up menu should appear)
5) Name the script
6) Select Python
7) Then select create
8) After it is created select it and click edit
9) A code editor will appear (I have VS Code on my PC so that is what opened up on my computer)
10) Copy the code from either script 1 or script 2
11) Instilation complete! =)

# How to use the scripts
It will promt you if you want the name of your design as part of the file name. It will always export with the name of the body. So name the bodies.
For both scripts you MUST select a folder or it wont work. Selecting downloads does work.
For script 2 select your bodies before you run the script.

Enjoy!
